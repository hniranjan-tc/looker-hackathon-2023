<h2><span style="color:#2d7eea">What Do I Watch</span></h2>


<p>We've created a dashboard that helps the user decide what to watch based on their most liked movie from a database of IMDB's top 1000: A text based movie recommender. Select a movie you liked to watch and our dashboard will recommend a list of 10 movies that you are bound to enjoy!</p>
<p>Our methodology uses a text-based recommendation system that relies on text processing to extract important words from one movies details to match with similar details in another movie to make recommendations! We use a combination of genre, director, stars and movie description to find movies that you are likely to enjoy.</p>
